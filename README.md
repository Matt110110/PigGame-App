# PigGame-App
The Android app version of the PigGame javascript project

##TODO : 
    1) Icon pack
    2) More backgrounds. The current one sucks.
    3) Use of AlertDialog instead of Toast messages. Toasts are good and all but are not legible.
    4) Design of the splash screen.

##DONE :
    > Logic of the game is complete and functional
    > Layout is more or less fixed. Some additional TextFields are needed
