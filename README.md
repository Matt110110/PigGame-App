# PigGame-App
The Android app version of the PigGame javascript project

## TODO : 
1. ~~Icon pack~~
2. More backgrounds. The current one sucks.
3. Use of AlertDialog instead of Toast messages. Toasts are good and all but are not legible.
4. ~~Design of the splash screen.~~

## DONE :
+ Logic of the game is complete and functional
+ Layout is more or less fixed. Some additional TextFields are needed

The project for me is more or less finished. The release-apk has been generated and for what it's worth the app is functional albeit not the most pretty out there. Some areas can be improved, but at my current knowledge level I am neither prepared for it nor do I want to do it. I will visit the project in a few weeks and try to make it pretty and get rid of all the copyrighted images present in it. It was a mistake to implement constraint layout witout proper planning and because of that I think I will leave the main game as it is.
